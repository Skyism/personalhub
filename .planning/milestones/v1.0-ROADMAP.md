# Milestone v1.0: MVP

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-01-14
**Phases:** 1-8
**Total Plans:** 18

## Overview

Personal Nexus delivers a modular personal dashboard with SMS-first expense tracking. The journey starts with foundational Next.js architecture supporting future modules, builds the Supabase backend and budget management core, implements manual transaction entry, adds the critical SMS logging integration via Twilio, provides spending analytics and visualization, finishes with mobile-responsive polish for on-the-go usage, and culminates with a distinctive UI overhaul that transforms the aesthetic into something memorable and delightful.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation

**Goal**: Establish Next.js project with modular architecture and base layout
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Plans**: 1/1 complete

Plans:
- [x] 1-01: Foundation Setup (Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind + modular structure)

**Details:**
Next.js 16.1.1 project initialized with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS v4. App Router structure established with feature-based modules. Created three top-level feature folders: app/finance, app/skincare, app/fitness. Each module has self-contained directory ready for Phase 2+ implementation. Basic root layout and landing page created with Personal Nexus branding.

### Phase 2: Supabase Backend

**Goal**: Set up Supabase client, create database schema for budgets/transactions/categories, establish API integration patterns
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Plans**: 2/2 complete

Plans:
- [x] 02-01: Supabase Client Setup (browser + server clients with SSR support)
- [x] 02-02: Database Schema Migration (budgets, transactions, categories tables with RLS policies)

**Details:**
Installed @supabase/supabase-js@2.90.1 and @supabase/ssr@0.8.0 packages. Created dual client architecture: browser client for Client Components (lib/supabase/client.ts) and server client for Server Components/Actions with cookie handling (lib/supabase/server.ts). Database schema created with budgets, transactions, and categories tables. RLS policies established (temporarily using TEMP_USER_ID workaround for single-user development).

---

### Phase 3: Budget Management

**Goal**: Build UI for creating monthly budgets with total and per-category allocations
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Plans**: 2/2 complete

Plans:
- [x] 03-01: Budget Overview & Creation (list, creation form, detail views)
- [x] 03-02: Category Management (category CRUD and budget allocations)

**Details:**
Budget overview page with list of monthly budgets. Budget creation form with month selector and total budget amount input. Budget detail page showing Total Budget vs Spent Amount with category breakdown. Category management with CRUD operations: create categories with names and colors, assign per-category budget allocations, edit and delete categories.

---

### Phase 4: Transaction System

**Goal**: Implement transaction list display and manual entry form with category assignment
**Depends on**: Phase 3
**Plans**: 2/2 complete

Plans:
- [x] 04-01: Transaction Display (list with date grouping and spending summary)
- [x] 04-02: Manual Transaction Entry (entry form with category assignment)

**Details:**
Transaction list with date grouping and daily spending summaries. Manual transaction entry form with amount input, note field, date picker, and category dropdown. Server Actions for transaction creation and deletion. Real-time updates to spending totals after transaction operations.

---

### Phase 5: SMS Integration

**Goal**: Integrate Twilio webhook to parse "amount note" SMS messages and create uncategorized transactions (categories assigned later in UI)
**Depends on**: Phase 4
**Plans**: 2/2 complete

Plans:
- [x] 05-01: SMS Webhook Integration (Twilio webhook with text parsing and idempotent transaction creation)
- [x] 05-02: Manual Transaction Categorization (inline category editing with Server Actions)

**Details:**
Twilio webhook endpoint with signature validation at /api/sms. Permissive text parser extracts amount and note from free-form SMS (no category matching). Idempotency via twilio_message_id unique constraint prevents duplicate transactions on retry. Uncategorized transactions created automatically. Inline category editor in transaction list allows users to assign categories later. TwiML error responses for parse failures, silent success for valid transactions.

**Key Decision:** Simplified SMS format from "amount category note" to "amount note" after user testing revealed category matching friction. Categories now assigned later in UI for better UX.

---

### Phase 6: Analytics Dashboard

**Goal**: Create spending visualization with category breakdowns, trends, and budget vs actual charts
**Depends on**: Phase 4 (can run parallel to Phase 5 if needed)
**Plans**: 3/3 complete

Plans:
- [x] 06-01: Chart Foundation and Category Breakdown (Recharts setup, responsive wrapper, pie chart)
- [x] 06-02: Spending Trends and Budget vs Actual (line/bar charts for trends and comparison)
- [x] 06-03: Analytics Dashboard Page (dedicated /finance/analytics route with all charts)

**Details:**
Recharts integrated with responsive wrapper component. CategorySpendingChart with pie chart showing spending by category. SpendingTrendsChart with line chart displaying daily spending over time. BudgetComparisonChart with horizontal bar chart comparing budget vs actual spending per category. Dedicated /finance/analytics page with budget selector dropdown and responsive two-column grid layout. Server-side data aggregation, client-side rendering.

---

### Phase 7: Mobile Polish

**Goal**: Optimize mobile experience with responsive layouts, touch targets, and performance tuning
**Depends on**: Phases 5 and 6 (final polish after core features complete)
**Plans**: 3/3 complete

Plans:
- [x] 07-01: Mobile Navigation and Touch Optimization (persistent bottom nav, viewport meta tags, 44px touch targets)
- [x] 07-02: Performance and Loading Optimization (loading.tsx, error.tsx, dynamic chart imports)
- [x] 07-03: Mobile Form and Input Optimization (inputMode, autoComplete, focus management, smooth scroll)

**Details:**
Persistent bottom navigation with 44px touch targets for Dashboard, Analytics, Budgets, and Categories. Viewport meta tags to prevent iOS zoom. Loading skeletons (loading.tsx) and error boundaries (error.tsx) for all finance routes. Dynamic imports for chart components to reduce initial bundle size. TransactionForm optimized with inputMode="decimal" for numeric keyboard, autoComplete attributes, max attribute on date input, useRef focus management for quick consecutive entries. All forms use text-base (16px) to prevent iOS Safari auto-zoom. Disabled styling consistency (opacity-60, cursor-not-allowed) across all forms.

---

### Phase 8: UI Overhaul

**Goal**: Transform the application with a distinctive, creative design system that avoids generic AI aesthetics. Implement unique typography, cohesive color themes, motion design, and atmospheric backgrounds to create a memorable user experience.
**Depends on**: Phase 7 (polish first, then transform)
**Plans**: 3/3 complete

Plans:
- [x] 08-01: Design Foundation (Tokyo Night OKLCH palette, Plus Jakarta Sans + JetBrains Mono typography)
- [x] 08-02: Component System (shadcn/ui Card/Button with Motion animations, semantic tokens)
- [x] 08-03: Visual Enhancement (mesh gradient backgrounds, shadcn/ui forms, frosted glass navigation, animated charts)

**Details:**
Tokyo Night-inspired OKLCH color palette with distinctive purple/cyan accents and deep backgrounds. Plus Jakarta Sans for body/headings, JetBrains Mono for numbers/data. shadcn/ui component system with Button, Card, and Input components. Motion library integrated for tap animations (scale: 0.95) and stagger-reveal effects. Mesh gradient backgrounds with 3 layered radial gradients (0.2-0.3 opacity). Frosted glass bottom navigation (bg-muted/90 backdrop-blur-md). Analytics charts with stagger-fade-in animations (0.4s duration, 0.1s delay). All Recharts updated to use CSS variables matching Tokyo Night palette. User verification confirmed: distinctive visual identity, 60fps animations, memorable brand experience.

**Design Principles Established:**
- Typography: Unique, beautiful fonts (avoid Inter, Roboto, Arial, Space Grotesk)
- Color: Cohesive themes with dominant colors and sharp accents, CSS variables
- Motion: CSS animations + Framer Motion for high-impact moments, staggered reveals
- Backgrounds: Layered gradients, geometric patterns, atmospheric depth
- Components: shadcn/ui as foundation, customized with unique aesthetic
- Minimalist but distinctive: Clean layouts with unexpected, delightful touches

## Milestone Summary

**Decimal Phases:** None (all phases were integer phases 1-8)

**Key Decisions:**

- SMS format simplified to "amount note" (Rationale: Better UX than exact category matching, assign later in UI)
- Tokyo Night color palette with OKLCH (Rationale: Distinctive design avoiding generic AI aesthetics)
- shadcn/ui + Motion component system (Rationale: Production-grade components with smooth animations)
- Dual Supabase client architecture (Rationale: Next.js App Router SSR requirements)
- Feature-based module folders (Rationale: Scales better than type-based folders)
- Recharts for analytics (Rationale: React-friendly, works well with CSS variables)

**Issues Resolved:**

- Fixed context overflow with modular architecture and proper file organization
- Resolved RLS policy blocking with TEMP_USER_ID workaround (proper auth deferred to v1.1)
- Fixed missing Twilio tracking columns during Phase 5 execution
- Resolved TypeScript strict mode compilation with proper type assertions

**Issues Deferred:**

- Authentication system - deferred to v1.1 (RLS policies use TEMP_USER_ID workaround)
- Recurring transactions - deferred beyond v1.0
- Multi-user functionality - deferred beyond v1.0
- Skincare and Fitness modules - architecture supports them, implementation deferred

**Technical Debt Incurred:**

- RLS policies allow TEMP_USER_ID instead of auth.uid() - must restore before production
- Foreign key constraints to auth.users removed - must restore with authentication
- No proper user authentication flow - blocking multi-user deployment
