# Phase 8.2 Plan 1: Home Page & Navigation Foundation Summary

**Established hierarchical navigation foundation with module cards and corrected home routing**

## Accomplishments

- Created home page with module navigation cards (Finance, Skincare, Fitness)
- Fixed BottomNav "Home" to navigate to app root instead of Finance landing
- Established components/navigation/ directory structure for upcoming components
- Applied Tokyo Night design system to home page

## Files Created/Modified

- `app/page.tsx` - Module navigation cards with responsive grid layout, Tokyo Night styling
- `app/finance/components/BottomNav.tsx` - Fixed "Home" href from `/finance` to `/`
- `components/navigation/.gitkeep` - Created directory for navigation components (Breadcrumbs, TopAppBar, DesktopNav)

## Decisions Made

**Module card design approach:**
- Used Link wrapper for active modules (Finance) with group hover effects
- Used div (non-interactive) for disabled modules (Skincare, Fitness) to prevent navigation attempts
- Applied opacity-60 and "Coming soon" text for clear unavailable state
- Leveraged Tailwind semantic tokens (primary, muted-foreground, border) for Tokyo Night consistency

**Navigation architecture:**
- Kept BottomNav in Finance module folder for now (Finance-specific component)
- Created top-level components/navigation/ for shared navigation components
- This separation allows Finance-specific nav patterns while preparing for cross-module navigation

## Issues Encountered

None

## Next Step

Ready for 8.2-02-PLAN.md (breadcrumb and top app bar system)
