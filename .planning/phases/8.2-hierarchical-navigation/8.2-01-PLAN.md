<objective>
Create home page with module navigation cards and fix BottomNav home routing.

Purpose: Establish foundation for hierarchical navigation by providing entry points to modules (Finance) and fixing BottomNav "Home" to correctly navigate to app root rather than Finance landing page.
Output: Working home page with module cards (Finance active, Skincare/Fitness coming soon) and corrected BottomNav routing.

**From Phase 8.1-03:** BottomNav currently has 5 items in grid-cols-5 layout with "Home" pointing to `/finance`. This needs to change to `/` (app root).

**From Phase 8 (UI Overhaul):** Tokyo Night design system with Plus Jakarta Sans + JetBrains Mono, OKLCH color palette, shadcn/ui components, Motion animations.

**From Research:** Home page should have module navigation cards (Finance available, Skincare/Fitness coming soon). Use Link for prefetching, proper icons from lucide-react, and Tokyo Night styling.

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Transform home page with module navigation cards</name>
  <files>app/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
Replace placeholder home page with module navigation cards layout:
- Create responsive card grid: `grid gap-6 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3`
- Three module cards: Finance (active, links to /finance), Skincare (disabled, "Coming soon"), Fitness (disabled, "Coming soon")
- Use lucide-react icons: DollarSign (Finance), Sparkles (Skincare), Activity (Fitness)
- Each active card: Link wrapper with `group` class, hover effects (`hover:border-primary`, bg-primary/5 overlay on hover), tokyo-night styling
- Each disabled card: div (not Link), opacity-60, no hover effects, italic "Coming soon" text
- Card structure: icon (h-10 w-10), title (text-2xl font-semibold), description (text-sm text-muted-foreground)
- Page header: centered text-4xl "Personal Nexus", subtitle "Modular dashboard for life tracking" (text-muted-foreground)
- Container: `container mx-auto px-4 py-12`, max-w-4xl for content
- Motion animations NOT needed here (simple static cards, avoid over-engineering)

DON'T use hardcoded hex colors - use Tailwind semantic tokens (primary, muted-foreground, border, etc.)
DON'T add navigation to modules that don't exist yet (only Finance is active)
  </action>
  <verify>
1. `npm run build` succeeds without errors
2. Visit http://localhost:3000 and confirm three module cards display in grid
3. Finance card is clickable Link (href="/finance"), Skincare/Fitness show "Coming soon"
4. Hover Finance card shows border change and background overlay
5. No TypeScript errors, console clean
  </verify>
  <done>Home page shows three module cards (Finance active link, Skincare/Fitness disabled), responsive grid layout, Tokyo Night styling, build succeeds</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Fix BottomNav home routing and create navigation components directory</name>
  <files>app/finance/components/BottomNav.tsx, components/navigation/.gitkeep</files>
  <action>
1. Update BottomNav "Home" item href from `/finance` to `/` to navigate to app root
2. Keep all other BottomNav items unchanged (Budgets, Wants, Analytics, Categories)
3. Create top-level `components/navigation/` directory with .gitkeep file for upcoming navigation components (Breadcrumbs, TopAppBar, DesktopNav will be added in next plans)

DON'T change BottomNav styling or icon - only change href value
DON'T add new navigation items to BottomNav - grid-cols-5 is already at capacity
DON'T move BottomNav to top-level components yet - stays in app/finance/components for now (Finance module-specific)
  </action>
  <verify>
1. Open app/finance/components/BottomNav.tsx and confirm "Home" href is `/` not `/finance`
2. Directory `components/navigation/` exists
3. Start dev server, navigate to /finance/budgets, tap "Home" in bottom nav, confirm it goes to app root (/) not /finance
4. TypeScript build passes
  </verify>
  <done>BottomNav "Home" navigates to `/`, components/navigation/ directory created, all other nav items unchanged</done>
</task>
