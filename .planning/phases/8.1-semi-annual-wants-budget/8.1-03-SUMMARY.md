# Phase 8.1 Plan 3: Wants Budget UI Foundation Summary

**Shipped wants budget overview UI with setup form, spending progress visualization, and Finance module navigation integration**

## Accomplishments

- Wants budget overview page at /finance/wants with Server Component data fetching
- Budget setup form with Server Action for create/update operations
- Spending overview with color-coded progress bar (green <80%, yellow 80-100%, red >100%)
- Navigation integration in Finance module (BottomNav and landing page)
- Tokyo Night design system styling throughout all components
- Mobile-responsive with 44px touch targets and grid-cols-5 bottom nav

## Files Created/Modified

- `app/finance/wants/page.tsx` - Server Component for wants overview with period detection
- `app/finance/wants/actions.ts` - Server Actions for budget CRUD (create/update)
- `app/finance/wants/components/budget-form.tsx` - Budget configuration form with validation
- `app/finance/wants/components/overview.tsx` - Spending status display with progress bar
- `app/finance/components/BottomNav.tsx` - Added wants budget navigation (5-item grid)
- `app/finance/page.tsx` - Added wants budget card to landing page

## Decisions Made

- Used inline edit mode for budget updates (toggle between overview and form) instead of separate edit page for better UX
- Implemented color-coded progress (green/yellow/red) based on spending percentage for quick visual status
- Added dollar sign prefix to amount input and used font-mono for numeric displays following Finance module patterns
- Positioned Wants nav item second in BottomNav (after Budgets, before Analytics) for logical feature grouping

## Issues Encountered

None

## Next Step

Ready for 8.1-04-PLAN.md (wants transactions CRUD for manual entry and management)
